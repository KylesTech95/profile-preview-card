profile preview card
# Intro
Greetings!
This is a mock design of a typical profile picture with a cool animation.

**View the animation by hovering over the profile picture**
Notice the "STATUS" icon in the top right corner of the card. 
To change this, access names.json and change the object's "online" property to true, null or false (default)

I release this data to the public to improve/modify and to enjoy.

If you want to view the doc, bootstrap.css is already linked to index.html. Feel free to modify and add your own classes if need be.

Enjoy!
